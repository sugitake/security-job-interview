# OSI model


| Layer No.  |  Layer  | Description | Data unit | Protocols  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7  | Application Layer  | Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services  | Data | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc  |
| 6  | Presentation Layer  | Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs | Data | TLS, SSL, MIME, XDR, etc  |
| 5  | Session Layer  | Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions  | Data| NetBIOS, PPTP, SAP, L2TP, etc |
| 4  | Transport Layer  | Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP | Segment, Datagram | Transmission Control Protocol(TCP), UDP, SPX, SCTP, DCCP, etc |
| 3  | Network Layer  | Decides which physical path the data will take | Packet | Internet protocols(IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IPSec and IGMP, etc |
| 2  | Data Link Layer  | Defines the format of data on the network| Frame  | ARP, CSLIP, HDLC, PPP, SLIP, etc  |
| 1  | Physical Layer  | Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium | Bit, Symbol | Bluetooth, IEEE.802.11, IEEE.802.3, L431, TIA 449, etc |
